One of the most common use cases that In Memory Data Grids (IMDG) like Hazelcast solve is that of the slow or unscalable Relational Database (RDBMS). Scaling a non performant RDBMS at best involves knowledge of complex configuration techniques and at worst could require the addition of expensive non commodity hardware. In this webinar we will demonstrate how you can easily add Hazelcast into the workflow of your application to solve this issue. Hazelcast can be used to solve the problem of slow reads by caching data in memory and it can also relieve stress on a Database where slow updates are an issue for your application.
